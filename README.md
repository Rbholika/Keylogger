# Keylogger - 100% successful Bypass of Windows11 Defender (2024)

# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive security research tool designed to demonstrate several aspects of system and network security. It includes:

- A **Python Keylogger** that captures keystrokes.
- A **PowerShell script (`stage1.ps1`)** that includes a reverse shell payload.
- A **second PowerShell script (`totallysafe.ps1`)** that executes the reverse shell and performs additional tasks.
- A **Python Nmap library** for network scanning.
- An **executable file** that integrates these components.

**Disclaimer: This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of these techniques is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before conducting any security testing.**

## Components

### 1. Python Keylogger
Captures keystrokes and stores them for analysis.

### 2. PowerShell Scripts
- `stage1.ps1`: Contains the reverse shell payload.
- `totallysafe.ps1`: Executes the reverse shell and performs additional actions.

### 3. Python Nmap Library
Used for network scanning to identify open ports, vulnerabilities, and firewall states.

### 4. Executable File
Consolidates all components into a single executable file for deployment.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PowerShell
- Netcat (optional, for specific network tasks)
- A Windows environment for testing

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - Ensure you have the Python Nmap library installed:

     ```bash
     pip install python-nmap
     ```

   - Make sure PowerShell is available and configured correctly on your system.

3. **Build the Executable**

   - Use tools like PyInstaller to convert the Python script into an executable:

     ```bash
     pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py
     ```

   Replace `your_script.py` with the Python script you wish to convert.

## Usage

**Warning: This tool should only be used in controlled, ethical scenarios.**

1. **Run the Keylogger**

   Execute the keylogger Python script or the compiled executable.

2. **Deploy PowerShell Scripts**

   - Run `stage1.ps1` using PowerShell:

     ```powershell
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File path\to\stage1.ps1
     ```

   - Ensure `totallysafe.ps1` is properly integrated into the environment.

3. **Start Network Scanning**

   Use the Python Nmap library for network scanning tasks.

4. **Monitor and Analyze**

   - Check the log files or data output by the keylogger.
   - Review network scan results for vulnerabilities.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations
